EXPERIENCE : At Interxion I have full P&L resposibility for the UK operations of Interxion. Interxion is a leading provider of cloud- and carrier-neutral colocation data centre services with 38 data centres across 11 countries and is head quartered in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.   Interxion follows a very focussed strategy that aims to add value to our customers by building profitable communities of interest in our data centres that benefit our customers greatly and allow them to grow their business.   My role is to continue with and expand on that strategy and further grow the UK business of Interxion. The Data Centre Alliance (DCA) is a professional Association comprising of Industry leaders from across the Data Centre Industry. It represents the date centre industry to the business world, the media, governments and the general public.  The DCA is an independent not-for-profit organisation run by and for the industry, open to all operators of data centres and server rooms however large or small.  In addition to promoting the adoption of best practice design and operational standards, our primary role is to act as a Accreditation Body for these standards.  The objective of the DCA is also to provide members with exclusive access to advice, guidance and academically peer reviewed documentation.   The DCA is committed to feeding expertise and experience from across the industry into academia and higher educational programmes to ensure the future health, growth and sustainability of the industry. Within the Colt Executive Committee I am responsible for the entire Data Centre portfolio across the Group. The current Data Centre footprint consists of 20 Data Centres accross 10 countries in Europe with sites in all the major cities in Europe. 2012 revenues across the Data Centre Services Unit amounted to ca. Eur 105m.   Given the quality of the data centres, the strategic locations and Colt's ability to deliver new Data Centres on customer premises where needed with guaranteed (short!) delivery times, the focus will now be on integrating the data centre portfolio into the overall Colt portfolio. The seamless integration of Colt's IT, network and data centre services will offer customers the ability to optimize their IT strategy in a way that is second to none. This optimisation will not only lead to reduced operating costs but also to a more effective and efficient IT infrastructure.   Colt Technology Services (COLT.L) is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is part of the FTSE250.  Responsible for managing and growing the Dutch subsidiary of Redbus Interhouse PLC, a UK public company that is traded on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange. I took the company from start up to profitability in extremely tough market conditions. I was involved in the start-up of the Dutch subsidiary of TELES AG, a German company traded on the TecDAX. At first as Sales Manager and at a later stage after more than 2 very successful years promoted to Managing Director of the Dutch subsidiary. This was followed a year later by the additional appointment as ad interim Managing Director of 2 French subsidiaries of TELES AG, where the main focus was on restructuring rather than day-to-day management.

EXPERIENCE : Digital transformation and implementation of new technologies. Over 15 years in Consulting, managing and developing projects and organizations in Europe, Asia and North-America. Experienced in marketplace, B2B SaaS, B2C, Social media, Digital Marketing and mobile applications. Opening of companies, post-acquisition transformation, operational excellence. Jobedin.com is the unique Chinese Social Media recruiting platform promoting MNCs to talents and providing innovative recruitment solutions (social networks recruiting, Digital marketing services, solid applications matching algorithms, on-line hunting, mobile recruitment, job-videos and video-CVs) for MNCs to identify and attract the right local resources. TEB is a designer and manufacturer of video surveillance and security equipment. The mission includes the strategic development of the company in China and Asia Pacific area (China, India, South-East Asia) through direct operations and the development of a distribution network in Asia. BravoSolution is a consulting company specialized in costs optimization, with offices in Europe and USA. I created the Chinese subsidiary in 2007 after having defined the business plan for this venture in 2006. I developed an organization and an operational team to manage effective international sourcing projects for the group and our own Asian customers. The Sourcing Forum is as a multi-sectoral platform to share practical experience and to systematically exchange information on supply of various commodities in China (e.g. metal sheets, tubes and pipes, production equipment and tools, consumables, etc). I chaired the forum during a year to arrange innovative discussions with high-level speakers on hot topics related to the fast evolution of the activities of procurement and supply-chain in China and Asia. I developed a specific practice focusing on the optimization of the procurement of industrial investments and facility management. I combined the expertise of civil engineers with procurement skills to challenge the design and construction suppliers in the definition, negotiation and management of contracts. The BU achieved great results developing the practice to large industrial companies looking to optimize this difficult and strategic purchasing category. Development of internet services dedicated to operations of the Group. Identification and implementation of "value added" web-services to generate value to the construction operations: on-line project management, document workflow and approval, electronic signature, e-conferences, on-line RFQ and eAuctions. Start-up project to set-up a marketplace dedicated to the construction industry. Design engineer for highway projects Management of international construction operations in Vietnam and Cambodia. Client position: management of the evolution of the works and supervision of the constructions' budget. Benjamin worked within my team in 2008 in Shanghai and I was his direct manager. His mission included two main assignments as purchasing consultant and operating team manager. Benjamin succeeded in all the missions he had to manage and reached the defined targets. He is motivated by his challenges and results oriented. I confirm his purchasing and team management skills and I personally recommend Benjamin as a great team leader. It has been great studying with Fabrizio. Very motivated person even for simulation games, he communicates his enthusiasm to his team and fights to win. Challenging also obvious notions, he helps going deeper in reflexion. He's a valuable team-mate and a trustable friend. Arnaud brings a lot of qualities to teamwork: creativity, wisdom, experience and respect of others thinking. He is open to the world and follows his passions.  His financial expertise is a must and I won't challenge him on that front.  I appreciated sharing time and learning with him. It has always been very instructive to work with Tobias. He has a very good sense of organization and management, and respect all people he is working with. I also witnessed his strong sales skills during hard business simulations.  He is definitely a resource who brings value to a team.

EXPERIENCE : French listed REIT My years at the CNIT with Thierry were undoubtedly part of the most exciting ones in my professional career.  The challenge we faced was to turn around a cumulated one-billion FF loosing company into a profitable and desirable asset to be later on brilliantly sold to European real estate leader UNIBAIL RODAMCO.  Under his supervision, I was in charge of the real estate subsidiary, and had to implement the same policies as those applicable to the other business units under his management (exhibition center, hotel and catering): in few words, to reduce the variable and fixed costs while investing to broaden our offers to the clients resulting into a dramatic development of the turnover, thus driving the bottom line to a strong profit.  Thierry demonstrated brilliant skills which were key to this turnaround : a superior understanding of the people and the financial matters, an acute foreseeing of the macroeconomic cycles and the clients needs, a real entrepreneur spirit and the ability to make people give the better of themselves.  These skills are rarely to be found into one single person, I therefore warmly recommend Thierry!

Steve Jobs It's a real pleasure to work with Laurent: low-key, yet efficient; few words, but each one counts; a potent listener, and highly productive towards customer specific contexts.   So If you're looking for someone with a clear and objective perspective on your operations, organisation and even strategy, and have it all documented in a concise, "executive summary" well marketed message (for a CxO profile audience), then you can reach out for Laurent in confidence. Jan !  What a great character, both professionally and personally: direct, efficient, engaged, customer focussed, and with (lots of) humour. And in parallel, his colleagues have an opt-in to collaborate in an informal and friendly relationship.  It's fun to work with Jan, issues get addressed (and therefore resolved), the projects he manages keep a dynamic momentum, and the business' perspective nevers gets lost of sight.  All the best to Jan in his new venture, it's going to be a fun ride.  John  Working with Kevin meant dealing with facts and figures, common sense and out of the box questions to progress. Kevin has now moved on, but I enjoyed his challenges with benefits for all involved. Alexandre is an extra-ordinary person: discreetly, yet efficiently, he analyses contexts, situations, business issues and then comes back with an acceptable value proposition that is thoroughly developed according to requirements and realistic achievements. He then pulls together a team that buys into his vision and which delivers on the value proposition, within a reasonable pace and budget.  It is no wonder he is also a long-distance runner, as this requires mental strength, determination, energy, and focus. It has been an enlightenment to work with Alexandre for a few years.

EXPERIENCE : All round HR Business Partner role to advice and support management of the European IT department with the implementation of its business strategy.  Within Tatasteel IJmuiden a large business programme has been developed to improve operational and business results. To achieve the targeted goals, a change in mindset and behavior is necessary within the company. The change programme acts as an enabler for these programmes and offers tools, techniques and insights on change and how this can be realized in order to reach business goals. We developed a change approach that is both pragmatic and challenging. I coordinate a central team of HR professionals that acts directly within the 5 business programmes as change lead.

Also take initiative to understand and apply recruitment policy and effectively interface with third party recruiters or other recruitment service providers where required.  The department offers vocational training in process engineering; lower, intermediate and higher vocational training. For lower and intermediate training the teaching method needed to change into competence based learning. A major change as teachers had to become coaches, learning materials needed to be rewritten to assignments, enlargement of work placements training in the mills with learning assignments. Training for both young full time students to become operator in one of the mills, and part time training for employees. World Class IJmuiden (WCIJ) was a large business programme to improve operational results within Corus IJmuiden. As a project manager I facilitated several work units in their process of improvement projects, led cross-border projects within IJmuiden and took care of the communication of WCIJ Account Manager within the Sales department, responsible for 3 large international clients in the Mill to Mill sector and several smaller accounts within the export department.
