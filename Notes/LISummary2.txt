EXPERIENCE : We create jewellery with a story; offering Art and ideas to people who treasure both. Inspired by childhood memories and fueled by the pursuit of happiness; the collection is designed for the undeterred showstoppers and the fearless head-turners. We focus on balancing the identities of the opposites; femininity against masculinity, Light versus Darkness. Thus, this infuses edgy and mostly androgynous designs, which gives the label a defining character.
